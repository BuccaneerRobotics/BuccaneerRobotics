- Hi, this is the collective account for all code involving FRC Team 8817, A.K.A. Buccaneer Robotics!
- This space will contain our code concerning our robots past and present (of which the present, we will be working on in the moment).
- We're currently learning Java for our current FRC robot, Trident! Please forgive if our code isn't the cleanest!
- We're not looking to collaborate at the moment, and mostly focusing on establishing our github (we're new to github.)
- You can reach us at our team email, buccaneerrobotics1@gmail.com
